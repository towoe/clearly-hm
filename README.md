# HM Slide Theme

A template theme for [HM](https://www.hm.edu) presentations for use with
[Polylux](https://github.com/polylux-typ/polylux/).

*Note: The theme is in an alpha state, it has not yet been widely tested for
presentations. It has also not yet been submitted as a package to
[Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe/), so it is a bit harder to get
started. Feedback is welcome!*
